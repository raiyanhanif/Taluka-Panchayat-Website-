Taluka Panchayat website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
"I had the opportunity to participate in a hackathon where I created responsive and user-friendly templates for a Taluka Panchayat website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project focused on improving the digital presence of local governance, offering a clean design, easy navigation, and essential features tailored for community access. It was a great learning experience where I applied my front-end development skills to a real-world civic solution."
